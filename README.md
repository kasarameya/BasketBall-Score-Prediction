# BasketBall-Score-Prediction
Predicting the score of a team by using Machine Learning Algorithms

The main purpose of this project is to build a model that will predict how many points a team will score in its game in the tournament.
We are provided with data of basketball regular seasons for the last 17 years for all the teams and the tournament results for every year.

We have used Principal Component Analysis, K-means clustering, Multiple Linear Regression and Cross Vaildation to build the model and validate its 
correction. In the we have plotted the graph using to check that if the model is appropriate.
